# Introduction

BuildCLI is a powerful command-line interface (CLI) tool aimed at simplifying Java project management.
It automates a wide range of development tasks, allowing developers to initialize projects, compile code, manage dependencies, run applications, and integrate CI/CD workflows directly from the terminal.

With BuildCLI, developers can:

* Quickly initialize a new project with a predefined structure.


* Compile and build Java applications using Maven.


* Easily manage project dependencies, adding or removing libraries in the `pom.xml`.


* Generate documentation for Java files using AI-powered tools.


* Dockerize projects with auto-generated Dockerfiles for easy containerization.


* Integrate CI/CD pipelines to automate deployment and testing workflows across platforms like GitHub Actions, Jenkins, and GitLab.


* This tool is designed to streamline the Java development lifecycle, making it easier for developers to focus on writing code while automating repetitive tasks and ensuring smooth project management.

# Project Structure

The BuildCLI project follows a modular structure to keep the code organized and maintainable.
Below is a brief overview of the main directories and files in the project:

* **src/:** Contains all source code files for the project.

* **main/java/:** This is where the core functionality of the CLI tool resides. It contains all Java classes that implement the different commands and features of BuildCLI.

* **resources/:** Contains configuration files and resources used by the application.

* **target/:** The directory where the compiled artifacts (such as JAR files) are stored after building the project with Maven.

* **docs/:** This folder holds all documentation files, including this one.

* **pom.xml:** The Maven Project Object Model (POM) file that defines the project's dependencies, build configurations, and plugins.

* **README.md:** Provides an overview of the project, setup instructions, and basic usage.

* **CONTRIBUTING.md:** Contains guidelines for contributing to the project, including how to report issues and submit pull requests.

  **This structure helps in organizing the different components of the tool, making it easy to navigate and extend as the project grows.**




# Key Classes and Their Purposes

Here are some of the key classes in BuildCLI and their roles:

*    **VersionCommand:** This class handles the version command, which displays the current version of BuildCLI. It's responsible for showing version information to the user when they run the buildcli --version command.


*    **CommandLineRunner:** This is the entry point for the application, where the command-line interface is initialized and commands are parsed and executed. It ties together all the functionality provided by BuildCLI.


*    **BuildCLIIntro:** This class provides introductory messages and updates when the user first runs BuildCLI. It may include information about new features, changelogs, or general usage tips.


*    **ProjectInitializer:** This class is responsible for initializing a new project, setting up the necessary directories and files (e.g., src/main/java, `pom.xml`, and README.md). It helps users quickly start a new Java project using BuildCLI.


*    **DependencyManager:** This class manages the addition and removal of dependencies in the project's `pom.xml`. It provides the functionality to add new libraries or update existing ones with specified versions.


*    **Dockerizer:** This class generates the Dockerfile for the project, enabling the containerization of the application. It simplifies the process of creating a Docker image for the Java project.


*    **CICDIntegration:** This class is responsible for setting up CI/CD pipelines by generating configuration files for Jenkins, GitHub Actions, and GitLab. It automates the setup of continuous integration and deployment workflows.

     **Each of these classes plays a crucial role in the functionality of BuildCLI, ensuring that developers have the necessary tools to manage their Java projects efficiently from the command line.**


# Navigating Commands and Subcommands

BuildCLI provides a variety of commands for managing your Java projects. Below is an overview of the most important commands and how to use them.
For more detailed help, you can always run:
   ```bash
      buildcli help
   ```


**1. Initialize a New Project**

This command initializes a new Java project with the required directory structure.

To initialize a project with a specific name, use the following command:
   ```bash
       buildcli project init MyProject
   ```    

This will create the project structure with MyProject as the base package name.
If you don’t specify a project name, the default package name buildcli will be used:

   ```bash
      buildcli project init
   ```   


This will create the project structure with buildcli as the base package name.

**2. Compile the Project**

   ```bash
      project build --compile
   ```   


This command compiles the Java project using Maven.

To compile the project, simply run:

   ```bash
      buildcli project build --compile
   ```   

**3. Add a Dependency to pom.xml**


This command adds a dependency to the project’s `pom.xml`.

* To add a dependency with the latest version, use:

   ```bash
      buildcli project add dependency org.springframework:spring-core
   ```   

* To add a dependency with a specific version, use:

   ```bash
      buildcli project add dependency org.springframework:spring-core:5.3.21
   ```   

**4. Run the Project**

This command runs the Java project using Spring Boot.

To run the project, simply execute:
   ```bash
      buildcli project run
   ```   

**5. Generate Dockerfile for the Project**

This command generates a Dockerfile for your project, enabling easy containerization.

To generate the Dockerfile, run:

   ```bash
      buildcli project add dockerfile
   ```   


**6. Set Up CI/CD Integration**

This command generates CI/CD pipeline configuration files for GitHub Actions, Jenkins, or GitLab.

For GitHub Actions, use:

   ```bash
      buildcli project add pipeline github
   ```   
For Jenkins, use:

   ```bash
    buildcli project add pipeline jenkins
   ```
