# Contribution

Contributions are welcome! Feel free to open **Issues** and submit **Pull Requests**.

### How to contribute:
1. **Check for an Existing Issue (Optional but Recommended):**
   Before starting your work, check if there is an open issue related to the feature or bug you want to address.
   - If an issue exists, please comment on it with a message like:
     ```
     I'm taking this issue.
     ```
     This helps prevent multiple contributors from working on the same issue simultaneously.
2. Fork the project.
3. Create a branch for your changes:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/my-feature
   ```
4. Commit your changes:
   ```bash
   git commit -m "My new feature"
   ```
5. Push to your branch:
   ```bash
   git push origin feature/my-feature
   ```
6. Open a Pull Request in the main repository:
- Create a new Pull Request, ensuring that the target branch is `develop`.
- Provide a clear description of your changes and any relevant information for the review process.
- Optional (but recommended): Use the PR template available at `.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE/default.md` to help structure your Pull Request and include all necessary details.
